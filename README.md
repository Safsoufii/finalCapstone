Installation
To install this project, simply download the recipes.html file and its associated index.css, recipe1.jpg, and recipe2.jpg files. You can then open the recipes.html file in any web browser to view the recipe cards.

Usage
Once you have opened the recipes.html file in a web browser, you can view the recipe cards. Each card displays the recipe title, a subtitle, a brief description, a list of ingredients, a button to view the recipe, a button to like the recipe, and a form to leave a comment.

To save a recipe to your personal folder, click the "Save for Later" button on the recipe card. This will add the recipe to your saved list, which is stored in your browser's localStorage. You can view your saved list by navigating to the "Personal Folder" page.

This project was created by Safa Husain. The addToSavedList function was adapted from a tutorial on FreeCodeCamp. The recipe card design was inspired by this Codepen.
